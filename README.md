git-recent - Show Your Branches in Chronological Order
======================================================

The git-recent tool works a lot like git-branch when it comes to list
your branches. But git-recent prints the list of branches sorted by the
date of its top-commit, newest first.

Use the -d or --decribe option to also describe all branches, but note
that this might take a while.

To get an overview of the available options, use the --help or -h option.


git-ff - Fast-Forward Your Branches
===================================

This is a tool to quickly fast-forward branches in your repository. It can
fast-forward checked-out and non-checkout-out branches.
